Why VirtualFleet ?
==================

The optimisation of the Argo array is quite complex to determine in specific regions, where the local ocean dynamic shifts away from *standard* large scale open ocean. These regions are typically the Boundary Currents where turbulence is more significant than anywhere else, and Polar regions where floats can temporarily evolve under sea-ice. **Virtual Fleet** aims to help the Argo program to optimise floats deployment and programming in such regions.
