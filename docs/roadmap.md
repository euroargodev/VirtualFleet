# Roadmap:

Software development roadmap:

- [x] Core library for specific Argo kernel on Parcels
- [x] Tutorial notebooks to get started
- [x] Extraction of a real plan for a given region (using argopy), *not automatic yet, but in notebooks*
- [x] Initial public release in June 2020 
- [ ] Clean software packaging (pypi install and unit testing)
- [ ] Improve documentation with regard to preparing the velocity field for the Virtual Fleet
- [ ] Allow users to control mission parameters (eg: cycle time, parking depth, and custom kernels)
- [ ] Module to compute Virtual Fleet KPI and statistics (eg. sampling, trajectories)
